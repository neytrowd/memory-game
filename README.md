I just wanted to how to use (Vanilla) JavaScript to manipulate DOM elements. I practiced more and had fun while developing a game.

Do you remember that game called Memory that you used to play with the actual paper cards? To win, you needed to memorize the position of the paired card. 

- The game consists of an even number of cards with a specific image on one side and a generic blue background on the other side.
- Each image appears on two cards.

**The game rules:**

- When the game starts, all cards are turned face down.
- The player then flips over two cards, selecting them by clicking on them.
- If the selected two cards have the same image, they remain face up. Otherwise, the cards flip back over after a short time.

The goal of the game is to get all the cards flipped face-up in the least number of tries.
